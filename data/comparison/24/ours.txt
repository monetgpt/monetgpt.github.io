**Exposure, Contrast & Tonal Range Adjustments**

**Editing Goal:**
The original image was taken at daytime, featuring harsh sunlight, with slightly underexposed shadows and a somewhat flat tonal range. Since it captures a portrait of a bird in a scenic outdoor setting, the editing should emphasize brightening the overall image, enhancing contrast to make the subject stand out, and recovering details in both shadows and highlights to create a more balanced and visually appealing photograph.

**Adjustment:** The blacks need to be very slightly increased.
**Issue:** In the original image, the black tones, particularly in the shadowed areas of the rock and the bird's dark feathers, appear somewhat dense and lack subtle detail. This makes these areas look slightly flat and less defined.
**Solution:** By very slightly increasing the blacks, the darkest tones will be lifted, revealing more detail in the shadowed areas of the rock and the bird's fur. The edited image will have richer blacks without losing shadow detail, adding depth and dimension to these areas.

**Adjustment:** The contrast needs to be slightly increased.
**Issue:** The original image appears somewhat flat and lacks visual punch. The separation between the lighter and darker tones is not strong enough, resulting in a less dynamic and slightly muted appearance overall.
**Solution:** By slightly increasing the contrast, the difference between the highlights and shadows will be enhanced. The edited image will have a more defined tonal range, making the subject and the scene appear more visually engaging and less flat.

**Adjustment:** The highlights need to be very slightly increased.
**Issue:** In the original image, the highlights, especially in the sky and on the brighter parts of the rock, are slightly subdued and lack a certain brilliance. This contributes to the overall slightly muted feel of the image.
**Solution:** By very slightly increasing the highlights, the brighter areas of the image, such as the sky and the sunlit parts of the rock, will gain a subtle lift in brightness. The edited image will have slightly more luminous highlights, contributing to a brighter and more airy feel without losing detail in these areas.

**Adjustment:** The shadows need to be slightly increased.
**Issue:** The shadows in the original image, particularly under the rock and on the darker side of the bird, are somewhat underexposed and obscure details. This makes these areas appear too dark and reduces the overall visibility of textures and forms within the shadows.
**Solution:** By slightly increasing the shadows, the darker areas of the image will be brightened, revealing more detail in the shadowed regions under the rock and on the bird. The edited image will have more open shadows, making textures and forms within these areas more visible and improving the overall balance of light and dark.

**Adjustment:** The whites need to be very slightly increased.
**Issue:** The white tones in the original image, such as in the clouds and the brightest parts of the sky, are not fully realized and appear slightly muted. This contributes to the image's overall slightly subdued and less vibrant appearance.
**Solution:** By very slightly increasing the whites, the brightest tones in the image will be enhanced, making the clouds and the sky appear brighter and more defined. The edited image will have slightly more pronounced whites, contributing to a brighter and more airy overall feel.

**Adjustment:** The exposure needs to be very slightly increased.
**Issue:** The original image is slightly underexposed overall, resulting in a somewhat dark and less vibrant appearance. The entire scene could benefit from a slight increase in overall brightness to enhance its visual appeal.
**Solution:** By very slightly increasing the exposure, the overall brightness of the image will be lifted. The edited image will be brighter and more vibrant, enhancing the visibility of all elements in the scene and creating a more inviting and well-lit photograph.

<|im_end|>**Editing Goal:**
The original image currently has a slight cool cast and under-saturated colors, which makes the scene look a bit muted and less engaging. Since it depicts a natural landscape with a bird, the editing goal is to refine the overall color balance to achieve a warmer and more vibrant mood. To accomplish this, adjustments like Temperature, Tint, and Saturation will help correct the cool tones and enhance the photo's overall color intensity, ensuring the final image conveys a more lively and visually appealing feel.

**White Balance & Global Saturation**

**Adjustment:** The Temperature needs to be increased very slightly.
**Issue:** In the original image, the overall tone appears slightly cool. This coolness is noticeable in the sky, which looks a bit bluish, and in the general ambiance of the scene, which lacks warmth. This cool tone makes the image feel less inviting and slightly muted in terms of color.
**Solution:** By very slightly increasing the temperature, the edited image will introduce a subtle warmth to the overall color palette. This will counteract the coolness, making the sky appear less intensely blue and the entire scene feel more inviting and naturally lit, enhancing the warmth of the sunlight on the rock and the bird.

**Adjustment:** The Tint needs to be increased very slightly.
**Issue:** The original image exhibits a subtle greenish tint, particularly noticeable in the lighter areas of the sky and the brighter parts of the rock. This slight green cast can make the image look slightly unnatural and less balanced in color.
**Solution:** By very slightly increasing the tint towards magenta, the edited image will neutralize the subtle greenish cast present in the original. This adjustment will result in a more balanced and natural color rendition, especially in the sky and the lighter tones of the rock, leading to a cleaner and more harmonious overall color balance.

**Adjustment:** The Saturation needs to be increased very slightly.
**Issue:** In the original image, the colors appear somewhat muted and lack vibrancy. The brown of the bird's fur, the blue of the sky, and the colors of the distant mountains all seem slightly desaturated, resulting in a less impactful and slightly dull visual experience.
**Solution:** By very slightly increasing the saturation, the edited image will enhance the color intensity across the entire scene. The brown of the bird will become richer, the blue of the sky will become more vibrant, and the colors of the mountains will gain depth, resulting in a more visually engaging and lively photograph with a subtle boost in color richness.

<|im_end|>**Editing Goal: Selective Color Adjustments**
The original image shows slightly muted orange tones, particularly in the subject's fur and the rock, which makes the overall scene appear a bit less vibrant and warm. Since it depicts a portrait of a bird in a natural outdoor setting, the editing should target the orange color range to enhance the warmth and richness of the scene without drastically altering the overall color balance. To achieve this, adjustments like increasing the saturation of orange and slightly shifting the hue of orange towards red will help create the intended effect of a more vibrant and inviting image with enhanced warmth in the key elements.

**Selective Color Adjustments**

**Adjustment:** The saturation of the orange tones needs to be slightly increased.
**Issue:** In the original image, the orange tones, especially noticeable in the bird's fur and the rock, appear somewhat desaturated and lack vibrancy. This makes these elements look less rich and less visually appealing, contributing to a slightly muted overall impression.
**Solution:** By slightly increasing the saturation of the orange tones, the orange areas in the image, such as the bird's fur and the rock, will become more vibrant and visually engaging. This will enhance the richness of these elements and contribute to a more lively and appealing image.

**Adjustment:** The hue of the orange tones needs to be very slightly shifted towards red.
**Issue:** In the original image, the orange tones in the bird's fur and the rock might lean slightly towards yellow, making them appear a bit less warm and potentially slightly less natural in the context of the outdoor setting.
**Solution:** By very slightly shifting the hue of the orange tones towards red, the orange areas will gain a warmer and richer tone. This subtle hue adjustment will make the orange elements appear more natural and contribute to a more inviting and harmonious color palette in the edited image. 

The parameters for other colors are already set at **optimal** values and do not require any modification.
