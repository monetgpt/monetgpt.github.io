**Exposure, Contrast & Tonal Range Adjustments**

**Editing Goal:**
The original image was taken at daytime, featuring soft, diffused lighting conditions, with slightly underexposed shadows and a general lack of contrast. Since it captures a scene of two birds in a natural setting, the editing should emphasize brightening the overall image, enhancing contrast to make the subjects stand out, and balancing the tonal range to reveal details in both shadows and highlights, aiming for a more vibrant and visually engaging photograph.

**Adjustment:** The blacks need to be mildly increased.
**Issue:** In the original image, the black tones, particularly in the background and within the shadows of the ground and the birds' bodies, are too deep and dense. This makes the image appear somewhat flat and obscures details in the darker areas, contributing to a slightly muted overall feel.
**Solution:** By mildly increasing the blacks, the darkest tones will be lifted, revealing more detail in the shadow areas of the background and the birds' dark feathers. The edited image will have a more open and less constricted feel in the darker regions, improving the overall tonal balance.

**Adjustment:** The contrast needs to be mildly increased.
**Issue:** The original image appears somewhat flat and lacks visual depth. The separation between the lighter and darker tones is not pronounced enough, resulting in a less dynamic and slightly dull appearance overall.
**Solution:** By mildly increasing the contrast, the difference between the highlights and shadows will be enhanced. The edited image will exhibit a greater sense of depth and visual interest, with the subjects and the environment appearing more distinct and less flat.

**Adjustment:** The highlights need to be very slightly increased.
**Issue:** In the original image, the highlights, especially in the brighter parts of the background and potentially on the lighter tones of the ground, are slightly subdued and lack a certain brightness. This contributes to the overall slightly muted and less vibrant feel of the image.
**Solution:** By very slightly increasing the highlights, the brighter areas of the image will gain a subtle lift in luminosity. The edited image will have a slightly brighter and more airy feel in the highlight regions, without risking blown-out highlights, thus enhancing the overall brightness of the scene.

**Adjustment:** The shadows need to be very slightly increased.
**Issue:** The shadows in the original image, particularly in the foreground and under the birds, are a bit too dark and dense. This obscures some details in these areas and contributes to the image feeling slightly underexposed and lacking in shadow detail.
**Solution:** By very slightly increasing the shadows, the darker areas of the image will be gently brightened. The edited image will reveal more detail in the shadow regions, such as the texture of the ground and the details within the darker parts of the birds, leading to a more balanced and detailed image.

**Adjustment:** The whites need to be very slightly increased.
**Issue:** The white tones in the original image are not fully realized, appearing somewhat muted and lacking in brightness. This contributes to the overall slightly subdued and less vibrant appearance of the image, preventing the brightest areas from truly standing out.
**Solution:** By very slightly increasing the whites, the brightest tones in the image will be subtly enhanced. The edited image will have a slightly brighter and more airy feel in the white areas, contributing to a more complete tonal range and enhancing the overall brightness of the scene.

**Adjustment:** The exposure needs to be very slightly increased.
**Issue:** The original image is slightly underexposed overall, resulting in a somewhat dark and muted appearance. This affects the overall brightness and vibrancy of the scene, making it less visually engaging and slightly less lively.
**Solution:** By very slightly increasing the exposure, the overall brightness of the image will be lifted. The edited image will be brighter and more vibrant, enhancing the visibility of all elements within the frame and creating a more inviting and lively photograph.

<|im_end|>**Editing Goal:**
The original image currently has a slight cool and greenish cast, which makes the scene appear somewhat muted and less inviting. Since it depicts a natural outdoor scene with two birds, the editing goal is to refine the overall color balance to achieve a warmer and more natural look. To accomplish this, adjustments like Temperature and Tint will help correct the cool and greenish tones, ensuring the final image conveys a more inviting and pleasant atmosphere.

**White Balance & Global Saturation**

**Adjustment:** The Temperature needs to be increased very slightly.
**Issue:** In the original image, the overall color tone appears slightly cool. This coolness is subtly visible across the entire scene, including the background and the subjects, making the image feel a bit less inviting and slightly muted in terms of warmth.
**Solution:** By very slightly increasing the Temperature, the edited image will introduce a touch of warmth, counteracting the coolness. This will result in a more balanced and natural color temperature, making the scene feel more inviting and pleasant, and enhancing the natural tones of the environment and the subjects.

**Adjustment:** The Tint needs to be decreased very slightly.
**Issue:** The original image exhibits a very slight greenish tint, particularly noticeable in the background and subtly affecting the overall color balance. This slight green cast can make the image appear a little less natural and slightly unbalanced in terms of color.
**Solution:** By very slightly decreasing the Tint, moving it towards magenta, the edited image will neutralize the subtle greenish cast present in the original. This adjustment will lead to a more balanced and neutral color palette, enhancing the natural appearance of the scene and ensuring that the colors are rendered more accurately and pleasingly.

<|im_end|>**Editing Goal: Selective Color Adjustments**
The original image shows slightly muted and less vibrant orange tones, particularly noticeable in the ground and the birds' skin, which makes the scene appear a bit dull and less engaging. Since it depicts a natural outdoor scene with birds, the editing should target the orange color range to enhance the warmth and vibrancy of the environment without drastically altering the overall color balance. To achieve this, adjustments like increasing the saturation of orange and slightly shifting the hue of orange towards red will help create the intended effect of a more vibrant and inviting image with enhanced natural colors.

**Selective Color Adjustments**

**Adjustment:** The saturation of the orange tones needs to be mildly increased.
**Issue:** In the original image, the orange tones, especially in the ground and the birds' skin, appear somewhat muted and lack vibrancy. This desaturation makes the scene look less lively and diminishes the natural warmth of the outdoor setting.
**Solution:** By mildly increasing the saturation of the orange tones, the ground and the birds' skin will gain a noticeable vibrancy. The edited image will have richer and more pronounced orange hues, enhancing the overall warmth and visual appeal of the scene.

**Adjustment:** The hue of the orange tones needs to be very slightly shifted towards red.
**Issue:** In the original image, the orange tones, particularly in the ground and the birds' skin, lean slightly towards yellow, making them appear a bit less rich and potentially slightly unnatural. This subtle yellow bias in the orange hues can detract from the overall color harmony.
**Solution:** By very slightly shifting the hue of the orange tones towards red, the orange colors in the ground and the birds' skin will become warmer and richer. The edited image will exhibit a more refined and natural orange tone, enhancing the overall color balance and visual harmony of the scene.
